How to make a Generation 7 Electronics Release.

Each part of Gen7 (Board, Endstop, etc.) gets its own release numbering.


1. Make the local Git repository ready. This should commit everything
   meant to go into the release and moving everything else away from the
   master branch.

2. Test this. That's obvious.

3. tools/make-release.sh

   This also tags the release with a trusted certificate, which is currently
   only available in Traumflug's local Home directory.

   As the tag description (an editor will open), use the list of new features
   wiki page.

4. Document the new release on
   http://reprap.org/wiki/Generation_7_Electronics
   in the appropriate section (Board, Endstop, Extension Board, ...)

   This typically means adding the links to Github and the release date to
   the already existing list of new features. For non-bugfix releases, move
   the list if the previous release to the history section and start a new
   "Plans for <next release>" list.

5. Use the wiki's move function to move the old endstop and board wiki page
   to the new version. Either edit the old page to have a short description
   on why the page is empty (Example: http://reprap.org/wiki/Gen7_Endstop_1.2)
   or copy all the contents back from the new page.

6. Edit one of the pages to find the edit for the templates "Gen7Endstop",
   "Gen7Board-AVR", "Gen7Board-ARM" and "Generation7Electronics". On bugfix
   releases, always include only the last bugfix version.

7. Edit the "Individual Components" section of the main page to link to the
   new versions. This is
   http://reprap.org/wiki/Generation_7_Electronics#Individual_Components

8. Start reviewing the new Board and Endstop pages ...
